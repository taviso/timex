# Project Ideas

- Scan firmware for instructions we can borrow to compress our code?
- LD EP, #0 should be unescessary - remove in cleancc.

- The problem with linking is that the text has to be at a specific location
    like segment text at 0x12345
    and if we want multiple files linked together, they have to know where
    the first one ends. We can do this, but will need some awk magic.
    like text at FirstOneEnd.
- This is the problem with even addinng .obj, need to do the layout manually
- __start must come first!! We need to figure out how to convince the linker to work, cause this isn't working. very first instruction must be _start!!!!__
- This isn't entirely true, your params file can control where things are located.
